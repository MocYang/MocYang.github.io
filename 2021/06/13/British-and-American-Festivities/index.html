<h2 id="Chapter-One-Columbus-1-Day"><a href="#Chapter-One-Columbus-1-Day" class="headerlink" title="Chapter One: Columbus[^1] Day"></a>Chapter One: Columbus[^1] Day</h2><p>The second Monday of October is Colembus Day! This festivity is celebrated only in the United States of America. Why?</p>
<p>During Christonpher  Columbus’ time people thought the world was flat. Columbus was born in Genoa, a beautiful Italian city on the north-west coast.</p>
<p>For many years he watched ships leave the port of Genoa. He noticed that these ships seemed to go under the horizon(水平线，地平线). He was convinced(确信) that the world was round, but no one believed him. He wanted to reach the East by sailing to the West. Queen Iabella and King Ferdinand of Spain believed Columbus’s theory. They gave him three ships, the Santa Maria, the Nina and the Pinta to travel and test his theory.</p>
<p>Columbus was an expert navigator. After a long and difficult voyage(航行), he and his men reached the North American continent(大陆)  on 12 Octover, 1492! The famous Italian exporer discovered the New World! After his great discovery a new era(纪元，时代) of exporation began and America was born.</p>
<p>Today most Americans celebrate Columbus Day with colourful parades(游行) the they elect（选举） a Columbus Day Queen. The parade is usually long with big floats dedicted to(纪念) Columbus and there are other multi-cultural floats too.After the parade there is usually a dinner and dance.</p>
<p>In San Francisco, California, there is also a re-enactment（再次展现） of Columbus discovery. A man dresses up as Columbus and several other men dress up as his sailors. They get into a boat and row to the beach. When they get out of their boat they kneel on the beach and thank God.</p>
<p>Americans enjoy remembering the great navigator.</p>
<h2 id="Chapter-Two-Halloween-万圣节-2"><a href="#Chapter-Two-Halloween-万圣节-2" class="headerlink" title="Chapter Two: Halloween(万圣节)[^2]"></a>Chapter Two: Halloween(万圣节)[^2]</h2><p>Halloween is celebrated on 31 October. It is an exciting event in the United States and in Great Britain. Every American calendar has Halloween marked on it.</p>
<p>Halloween has ancient Celtic origins. On the Celtic calendar Samhain was the last day of summer and the last day of the year, 31 October.</p>
<p>The Celtic（凯尔特人的） priests（祭司）, called Druids(德鲁伊特), practised(举行) religious（信教的，虔诚的） rituals（仪式） and magic on Samhain. They also predicted  the future. On this day the Celts made big fires and dressed in scary costumes(服装). They wanted to frighten the evil spirits.They dressed as ghosts, skeletons(骷髅) and witches. They believed that ghosts came out of their tombs(坟墓) on the night of 31 October.</p>
<p>Samhain also bacame a harvest(丰收) festival after the Roman invasion（侵略） of Britain in 43 AD.Christian practices replaced pagan(爬杆) practices.The Christians called 1 November All Hallows’ Day, the day of all Saints. The evening of 31 Octover was called All Hallows’ Eve. This became Halloween.</p>
<p>At Halloween American children in elementary schools take their costumes and masks to shool. Typical Halloween costumes are the witch, ghost, skeleton, monster, vampire(吸血鬼) or alien. Young people have fun making their own costumes, but some prefer bo buy them. In the afternoon the children put on their costumes and have a Halloween party at school. School are decorated with pumpkins(南瓜), ghosts, witches and bats.</p>
<p>It is popular tradition to make jack o’lanterns(杰克灯) out of pumpkins. People put them in front of the windows of their homes. The jack o’lantern is of Celtic origin too.There are funny Halloween games such as bobbing for apples. Favourite Halloween foods are candied apples, nuts, liquorice(甘草糖),popcorn（爆米花） and pumpkin pie.</p>
<p>American teenagers have a Halloween party in the evening. The party is usually in the school  gymnasium and everyone wears a costume and mask. The best costume usually wins a prize.</p>
<p>In the 19th century Irish(爱尔兰) immigrants(移民) took their Halloween customs to the United States. They introduced the custom of <em>trick-or-treating</em>. American and British children and teenagers go  <em>trick-or treating</em> on Halloween evening. They go from house to house in their customs and ring doorbells. When the door opens they shout, “Trick or treat?” People usually give them sweets or money. If not, the children playa trick. They write on windows with soap or spray shaving cream(奶油)cars and people!</p>
<h2 id="Chapter-Three-Guy-Fawkes’-Night-3"><a href="#Chapter-Three-Guy-Fawkes’-Night-3" class="headerlink" title="Chapter Three: Guy Fawkes’ Night[^3]"></a>Chapter Three: Guy Fawkes’ Night[^3]</h2><p>The fifth of November is Guy Fawkes’ Night or Bonfire Night. This is a British festivity.</p>
<p>The story of Guy Fawkes goes back to the early 1600’s. During this period there were religious(宗教的) problems between Protestants(新教徒) Catholics（天主教徒） in British. King James I was a protestant and he passed severe laws against Catholics.They were not permitted to have religious services.</p>
<p>A group of 12 Catholics decided to kill King James I and destroy the Parliament(英国议会) Building! They planned to blow up the Houses of Parlianment on 5 November 1605,when the King was present. This was called the Gunpowder（火药） Plot(密谋).</p>
<p>The leader of the plot was Robert Catesby. The plotters put 30 barrels(桶) of explosives（炸药） in the cellars(地窖) under the Parliament Building.</p>
<p>Guy Fawkes was an expert with explosives. His responsibility was to guard the barrels of explosives and light the fuse on 5 of November.</p>
<p>The King’s soldiers discovered the plot! Guy Fawkes was immediately arrested and tortured(折磨). The other plotters were found three days later. Guy Fawkes and the others were hanged(吊死).</p>
<p>On the night of 5 November 1605 many people in London were happy bacause the plot was discovered. To celebrate they started bonfires(篝火) in the street. Someone made en effigy(肖像) of Guy Fawkes and burned it.</p>
<p>Ever since that day the British have celetrated Guy Fawkes’ Night.</p>
<p>Today young people in Britain make a Guy with old clothes and fill him with newspaper. Then they go around the streets with Guy and ask for “a penny for the Guy?” With this money they buy fireworks.</p>
<p>On the night of 5 November there are fireworks and big bonfires to burn the Guy. Some people have bonfires in their back gardens. Young people love the noise, excitment and colourful fireworks</p>
<p>On this night they eat toffee(太妃糖) apples.</p>
<p>In Lewes, Sussex, there is a big public festival on Guy Fawkes’ Night. People dress in historic costumes.The Guy is burned on top of a hill on an enormous(庞大的) bonfire. There are also brilliant fireworks.</p>
<p>Here is a rhyme（打油诗） about Guy Fawkes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Remember, remember</em></p>
<p><em>The fifth of November</em></p>
<p><em>Gunpowder, treason（叛国） and plot.</em></p>
<p><em>I see no reason</em></p>
<p><em>Why gunpowder and trason</em></p>
<p><em>Should ever be forgot</em></p>

<h2 id="Chapter-Four-Thanksgiving-4"><a href="#Chapter-Four-Thanksgiving-4" class="headerlink" title="Chapter Four: Thanksgiving[^4]"></a>Chapter Four: Thanksgiving[^4]</h2><p>Thanksgiving is a very important American festivity and it is celebrated on the last Thursday of November. However,schools and many shops and offices are closed for four days: Thursday,Friday,Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<p>Thanksgiving is a special day for families to be together and to thank God for all they have. Americans travel great distances to be with their families on this occasion.</p>
<p>Why is Thanksgiving such an important day? The tradition started with the Pilgrims(朝圣者),the founders(创建者) of America.The Pilgrims left Great Britain in 1620 because of religious persecution(迫害).They wanted to start a new life in America and practise their religion in freedom.</p>
<p>One hundred men,women and children left British on a small ship called the  sea Mayflower. Their voyage(航行) was very difficult.Many Pilgrims died during the voyage.</p>
<p>They arrived on the north-east coast of North America in December 1620 and founded Plymouth. The area was a wilderness. It was almost winter and they had no homes and little food.</p>
<p>They immediately built small homes,But it was too late to cultivate(种植) crops(庄稼，作物).</p>
<p>The winter was very cold and harsh(严酷). Almost half of the Pilgrims died because their living conditions were very bad.</p>
<p>The friendly Wampanoag Indians helped them during the long winter.</p>
<p>In the spring the Pilgrims met an Indian called Squanto. He explained how to grow corn,hunt and live in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Soon the Pilgrims and the Indians became good friends. The Pilgrims worked hard and cultivated crops. The summer harvest was excellent. By November 1621 everyone had food and a home. There was hope for the future.</p>
<p>Governor William Bradford, The Pilgrim leader, decided to celebrate with a dinner for the Pilgrims and the Indians. He wanted to give thanks to God.This was the first Thanksgiving dinner and it lasted for three days.</p>
<p>Today the traditional Thanksgiving meal is similar to the first. People eat roast(烤，烘焙) turkey, sweet potatoes,corn,cranberry（越莓） sauce（调味汁） and pumpkin pie.Most families start the meal with a prayer. The long Thanksgiving weekend is the perfect time to start, Christmas shopping! Big stores and shops are open on Friday, Saturday and Sunday for the Christmas shoppers.</p>
<h2 id="Chapter-Five-Christmas-5"><a href="#Chapter-Five-Christmas-5" class="headerlink" title="Chapter Five: Christmas[^5]"></a>Chapter Five: Christmas[^5]</h2><p>On 25 December Great Britain and the United States(and many other contries) celebreate Christmas. The word Christmas comes from the Old English “Cristes maesse”, Christ’s mass. On this day Christians celebrate the birth of Christ.</p>
<p>Kindness and giving are the spirit of Christmas. Charles Dickens, the famous British writer, wrote A Christmas Carol（圣诞颂歌）, a story about the true meaning of Christmas.</p>
<p>Why is Christmas celebrated on 25 December?</p>
<p>Christmas comes from two pagan festivals. People celebrated the winter solstice(冬至) on 21 or 22 December. The Roman emperors(皇帝) chose 25 December as the birthday of the sum(natalis solis).</p>
<p>After the winter solstice,the days become longer and the sun is higher in the sky. In Ancient Rome this was the season of Saturnalia.Saturnalia was a time of merrymaking(寻欢作乐). During Saturnalia the Romans exchanged presents.</p>
<p>The pagan tribes of Northern Europe enjoyed a 120day winter festival called Yule. Yule had its own traditions of Yule cakes, fir trees（松树）, holly(冬青木), mistletoe and presents. Fir trees and holly are still a symbol of Christmas. Today a branch of mistletoe in the house has another meaning: when a boy and girl meet Under the mistletoe they usually kiss! The custom of kissing under the mistletoe is an ancient Celtic rite(仪式).</p>
<p>Medieval Christmas was a long event. It lasted twelve days like the Yule festival. Celebrations started on 25 December and ended on the night of 6 January.</p>
<p>Chistmas is the biggest holiday on the American and British calendar.However, in Scotland, New Year is more important.</p>
<p>In Great Britain and the United States people prepare for Christmas weeks before 25 December. Cities and towns are beautifully decorated with Christmas symbols: the Christmas tree, Santa Claus(圣诞老人), colorful lights and much more. Shop windows are full of presents for everyone. People are busy buying presents. There are Santa Claus everywhere.On street corners people sing Christmas carols. In British many children go carol singing with an adult. They go from house to house and sing.They usually receive money for their singing. They use this money to buy presents. There is a joyous atmosphere(喜庆的气氛).</p>
<p>Christmas today respects many of the old traditions and has added new ones.</p>
<p>The modern Christmas tree originated in wetern Germany long ago.The Germans put up a fir tree in their homes and decorated it with biscuits and candles. German settlers took this tradition to North America in the 17th century. By th 19th century Christmas trees were very poppular in the United States.</p>
<p>In British the Christams tree became popular after 1840. The German Prince Albert,Queen Victoria’s husband, took the Christmas tree to the British Royal Family. Soon the Christmas tree became popular all over Great British. There is a big tree every year in the Trafalgar Square, London.</p>
<p>Today America’s most famous Christmas tree is in the Rockefeller Center New York City.</p>
<p>The Empire State Building(帝国大厦) in New York City is one of the tallest buildings in the world.At Christmas the top of the building is illuminated(照亮，阐明) with red and green lights!</p>
<p>Today almost every Christian family has a decorated Christmas tree at home or in the garden. Some families put up the tree on Christmas Eve and others put it up at the begining of December.Many families put a Nativity scene under the Christmas tree. St. Francis of Assisi created the first Nativity scene in the 1200’s!</p>
<p>Many Americans wear Christmas clothes during the Christmas season.These are clothes with Christmas colours and symbols.</p>
<p>Christmas crackers(爆竹) are an old tradition. They were invented in London, Two people pull the cracker until it “bangs” and opens. Inside there is usually a small present, a paper hat and a joke.</p>
<p>In the United States there are “Christmas shops “ in many cities, They sell all types of Christmas trees, ornaments(装饰物) and other decorations for the home, “Christmas shops” are open all year long, so you can buy your Christmas tree in June!</p>
<p>It is usualy to send Christmas cards to relatives and friends. The first Christmas card was designed in Britain by John Callcott Horsley in 1843. A thousand copies of the card were printed in London. The design was a family party with the words “A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you”</p>
<p>In the mid-19th century a shop owner in Albany, New York, made a card that said, “Christmas greetings from Pease’s Great Variety Store.” This was the begining of the big Christmas card industry.</p>
<p>The figure of Santa Claus comes from St.Nicholas, a 4th century Christian bishop(主教) of Asia Minor. He was famous for his generosity and kindness. The Dutch settlers of New York brought the tradition of Sinterklaas (Santa Claus) to America.</p>
<p>Father Christmas, or Santa Claus, is an important part of the Christmas tradition, Children write letters to him and ask for special presents.</p>
<p>Today we see Santa Claus as an old man with a white beard, dressed in a red suit. He drives a sleigh(雪橇) pulled by reindeer（驯鹿） and comes down the chimney(烟囱) with toys for the children.This  image of Santa Claus was created by the American cartoonist(漫画家) Thoms Nast in 1863.</p>
<p>American and British children put out a stocking on Christmas Eve because they hope to receive presents from Santa Claus. Then they go to bed early because they want Santa Claus to come. Many Christians go to church services at midnight and others go on Christmas morning.</p>
<p>Christmas presents are usually opened on Christmas morning. Aftef Christmas dinner many families listen to the traditional Queen’s Speech in Britain and watch special Christmas television programmes.Children play with their new toys.</p>
<p>In Britain some people go for a Christmas Day swim in the sea or in a lake. In Hyde Park in London some courageous people swim in the Serpentine(蛇纹石)!</p>

<li><p>[^4]: 感恩节（Thanksgiving Day），西方传统节日，是美国人民独创的一个节日，也是美国人合家欢聚的节日。 初时感恩节没有固定日期，由美国各州临时决定。直到美国独立后的1863年，<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%9E%97%E8%82%AF/91">林肯</a>总统宣布感恩节为全国性节日 [1] 。1941年，美国国会正式将每年11月第四个星期四定为“感恩节”。感恩节假期一般会从星期四持续到<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%98%9F%E6%9C%9F%E5%A4%A9/4164710">星期天</a>。感恩节旨在感谢生命中遇到的一些人和事。感恩节这一天。美国举国上下热闹非凡，有许多戏剧表演、化装游行、体育比赛等等.每逢感恩节这一天，美国家家户户都要吃火鸡，他们通常还吃一些传统的菜肴，例如西葫芦、奶油洋葱、土豆泥、番瓜派等等。家庭成员无论在哪都会赶回家过节。</p>

<li><p>[^5]: 基督教纪念耶稣诞生的重要节日。亦称耶稣圣诞节、主降生节，天主教亦称耶稣圣诞瞻礼。耶稣诞生的日期，《圣经》并无记载。公元336年罗马教会开始在12月25日过此节。12月25日原是罗马帝国规定的太阳神诞辰。有人认为选择这天庆祝圣诞，是因为基督教徒认为耶稣就是正义、永恒的太阳。5世纪中叶以后，圣诞节作为重要节日，成了教会的传统，并在东西派教会中逐渐传开。因所用历法不同等原因，各教派会举行庆祝的具体日期和活动形式也有差别。圣诞节习俗传播到亚洲主要是在十九世纪中叶，日本、韩国等都受到了圣诞文化的影响。现在西方在圣诞节常互赠礼物，举行欢宴，并以圣诞老人、圣诞树等增添节日气氛，已成为普遍习俗。圣诞节也成为西方世界以及其他很多地区的公共假日。</p>
