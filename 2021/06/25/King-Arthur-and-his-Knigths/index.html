<p>When King Uther died in 509, Britain had no King. The country had many problems.</p>
<p>Merlin went to the Archbishop of Canterbury(坎特伯雷主教) and said, “Britain must have a king. We must find one. Call all the noblemen(贵族成员) of the Kingdom. Tell them to meet at the great chruch in London on Christmas Day. There God will show us the new King.”</p>
<p>On Christmas Day, all the noblemen were in the great church. Outside the church there was a big stone with a sword in it. These words were written on the big stone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He who pulls the sword out of this stone is the true King of Britain.</p>

<p>Sir Ector said,”Arthur, you are now the King of Britain.”</p>
<p>Arthur said, “Father, I don’t want to leave you!”</p>
<p>Sir Ector said, “I’m not your real father. I don’t know who you are. The magician Merlin brought you to us when you were born. I raised you like a son, and I love you. Now you are a King. God wants you to lead Britain. You must go and do your duty.”</p>

He was about twenty years old. He lived at Camelot. His first years as a King were difficult. He fought against many enemies from other lands, particularly the Saxons. Some noblemen of his court caused trouble. They did not want to obey a young King.</p>
<p>King Arthur was very adventurous. He liked riding his horse and looking for adventures. He was courageous, loyal(忠实) and friendly. Hie people loved him.</p>
<p>One day, King Arthur was riding in the forest. He saw a fountain(喷泉). Near the fountain there was a kinght named Sir Pellinore.</p>
<p>“Stop!” Said Sir Pellinore. “You cannot got past the fountain! You must fight with me first!”</p>
<p>King Arthur answered, “I’m ready to fight!” The two knights began fighting. First they fought with their lances(长矛). Then they fought with their swords.</p>
<p>During the fight, Arthur’s sword broke. Sir Pellinore said, “I’m the winner!”</p>
<p>At that moment, Merlin appeared and said, “Pellinore, this knight is your king! King Arthur!” Sir Pellinore stopped fighting immediately.</p>

I am King because of that sword. I must have another sword.”</p>

<p>“Look!” said Merlin. “That is the sword and that is the Lady of the Lake. Ask her kindly and the sword is yours.”</p>
<p>Arthur saw a beautiful lady in a boat on the lake. He asked her, “Can I have the sword?”</p>
<p>She answered, “Yes, you can have it. Take my boat and go and get it.”</p>

<p>“Look, Merlin” he said, “the word Excalibur is written on it.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Excalibur is the greatest sword in the world, But its scabbard is more precious(珍贵).”</p>
<p>“Why?” asked Arthur.</p>
<p>“It has a great magic power,” said Merlin. “When you wear it, you never bleed I even if you are wounded(受伤). When you fight, you must always have the scabbard with you.”</p>
